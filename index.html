            Woomy! This is Izzy here! I gotta say, I think the easiest way to connect with people is by sharing the
            things you enjoy! When two people like the same thing, they have lots to talk about. So here are some
            things
            I love!
        </p>
        <p class="bio">
            I love stories! I of course write my own story and publish it online in the form of an online comic or
            “webcomic.” It’s called <a href="http://heroesofthantopolis.com/" target="_blank">Heroes of
                Thantopolis</a>
            and it is
            totally free to read! I’ve been working on the comic
            for almost 5 years now so there is a lot of content to peruse. I love to read books and get immersed in
            stories. I love hearing about my friends’ stories too!
        </p>
        <p class="bio">
            I love YouTube! YouTube videos are so entertaining and there are so many to look through. The categories
            of
            videos I watch the most are Gaming and Animation. When it comes to gaming, I love Nintendo games and
            watch a
            lot of Nintendo channels. My two favorite games to watch on YouTube are Splatoon 2 (which I am great at)
            and
            Smash (which I wish I was great at).
        </p>
        <p class="bio">I love nature! Animals, plants, rocks, bodies of water, you name it, I love it! I live right
            near
            the beach and in the summer I love to go and watch the waves on the shore. I love visiting the Chicago
            Botanical Gardens. I know its winter now, but they have a lovely greenhouse exhibit that is open all
            year
            round! And when it comes to animals, I pretty much love all of them. Now I don’t have any pets, but I DO
            have a ton of animal plushies, so that fills the void a bit.
        </p>
        <p class="bio">And most of all, I love to learn! Whether it’s learning from a book, from a newspaper, from
            the
            TV, from a magazine, from online, from classes, from the people in my life, I love to learn! I have an
            unquenchable fire in me that longs to consume more and more information. I’m so excited to learn
            together
            with everyone!
        </p>
        <p class="bio">
            Thanks for reading!
